## About

<table><tr><td>

Studying composite topology diagrams can make learning Microsoft Azure easier. Here you'll find the first of what I hope is several Azure infrastructure diagrams in both Microsoft Visio (.vsdx) and bitmap image (.png) format.

Eventually you'll find Azure Bicep deployment templates for every resource contained in the diagram. Please feel free to submit a pull request if you have code to share!
